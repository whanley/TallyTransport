### My comments to the city commissioners:

I am writing in opposition to the proposed sale of City land (parcel 41-02-20-951-000-1) to the developers of Stadium Enclave. I have three main concerns.

First, this sale would eliminate any chance a direct connection between FSU and the St. Mark's trail. Imagine the beauty of an entrance onto the trail from the heart of Collegetown via the monumental intersection of Woodward and Gaines. Every piece is already in place (except for CSX permission to cross its tracks), but the proposed sale would permanently sever any possibility of this link between the heart of FSU and points south. All of the proprety for this connection has been assembled. The parcel between Gaines and CSX (21-35-51-000-123-0) is owned by the State trust. Lake Elberta Park extends all the way to the southern boundary of CSX land, passing through two parcels (41-02-51-006-016-0 and 41-02-51-006-017-0) then connecting to the city parcel proposed for sale. I understand that CSX has historically refused to allow crossing access, but this land has been assembled at great cost in the expectation of such access, and it should not be abandoned now. Planners at FSU (where I am a faculty member) have worked for years to build corridors towards the Mag Lab and the FSU reservation. This would permanently impede their efforts.

Second, the stub trail included in the current development plan is grossly inadequate. Even if the developer builds it to a 12' width (which they seem reluctant to do), this multi-use sidewalk does not meet the high standards of the rest of the trail (and indeed the planned regional network). The terminus onto the east sidewalk of Lake Bradford Road is a pitiful compromise; unattractive and unsafe, it leads nowhere. The proposal is far inferior to the what was envisaged when the Trust for Public Land purchased the property in 2004, or when the city purchased the property from the Trust in 2005. And beyond this parcel, the existing 40' easement on the Cemex property (41-02-20-078-000-0) promised much better--including direct access to the intersection of Lake Bradford and Gaines. Instead this corner will offer the prospect of a locked gateway.

Third, this sale and development goes against all the years and millions of dollars invested in creating the sort of urban core that Tallahassee needs. I understand that the city must work to balance public and private interests, but in this case the balance has been lost. All of the recent developments in the Gaines Street area are open to the city and street, and most of them contain commercial space on the ground floor. "Stadium Enclave," on the other hand, is an isolated, paved expanse suited to a different time and place. The developer has not shown an appreciation for the course that the city has charted for this district, and this plan does not warrant the transfer of public trust land (purchased at $239K/acre) to private hands (at $15K/acre), even if the transaction didn't send so much public wealth to private hands. The claim that the developer's construction of the trail is suitable compensation is unsustainable--the latest greenway plan prices construction of this segment at $120K. It is my understanding that all of the property that the City and State have painstakingly purchased with considerable public funds, for the express purpose of completing the trail, has been graded and prepared, and that soil contamination has already been remediated (also with public funds). As stewards of public funds, public lands, and the public good, I urge you to oppose this unbalanced deal.

I understand that the developer has suggested that if this sale is refused, he will reduce the size of the development and proceed to build on the Cemex parcel only. This seems to me to be a very desirable outcome. The trail extension may not be completed in the near future, but we cannot abandon this trust and get so little in return.
